 * This view is shown to the user after they have successfully created a new account.
 *
 * For a full list of variables available in this template and their associated values, do the following:
 *
 * 1. Create a file called globals.vm in <installation-dir>/usr/share/templates/overrides/fragments
 *
 * 2. Add the following to this new file:
 *
 * <!--
 *    All variables:
 *    #foreach ($entry in $_context.entrySet())
 *        $entry.key => $!entry.value
 *    #end
 * -->
 *
 * 3. Request this template again and view the HTML source code. All variables and their values will be shown in an
 *    HTML comment at the top of the file.

 * The sections and variables defined above will be available in the layout. If the layout is overridden (i.e.,
 * third-party/base/layout.vm exists), that one will be used; otherwise, the default one will be used.
 *
 * If you plan to only override the layout for some pages, you should use a different template besides layout.vm. For
 * example, you could call that layout special-layout.vm. You could put this directly in the third-party directory,
 * but the convention would be to place it in third-party/base. In either case, this one would be used by only this
 * template while others would continue to use layout.vm.
 *
 * This technique can also be helpful during the development process. In such cases, you may create a layout that
 * you are testing out or one that prints all variables or extra debug statements. To use that one instead, use that
 * one as the path below. In such cases, you may also place the layout in the third-party-debug template package
 * directory (i.e., <installation-dir>/usr/share/templates/third-party-debug). When a layout is found there, it will
 * be used before any in third-party or provided. By placing tempaltes and layouts in this directory, it will be more
 * clear that the template is not meant for production use.
 *
 * Another helpful technique when the layout has been overriden everywhere is to save the provided layout in a file
 * called provided-layout.vm under third-party-debug. This will allow you to quickly return to the provided layout for
 * a particular template while continuing to use your custom one everwhere else on your site.
